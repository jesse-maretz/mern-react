# Mern Solo React Project
This project lists the entire New York Yankees roster based on 2020 MLB API data. The idea is to play around with the roster creating what you think the best NYY roster would be for 2021.

## Create
Creating a player is done through an input formunder the roster.

## Read
Reading is taken care of by the landing page rendering the entire NYY roster.

## Update
Updating a player entry is done by putting a player's ID in the ID input field and updating the name in the name field to the right of it. Submitting this form will then update the player entry's name.

## Delete
Deleting a player is done by putting a player's ID into the delete field and then submitting the form. This may require you to refresh the page in order to render the updated roster.
